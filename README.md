# Driver-Drowiness-Detection

## Introduction

With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Computer vision came into the scene in the late 1960s. The purpose of this technology is to increase the intellect of the artificial mechanism by installing the cameras  into  them  and describe  whatever  they  see just  like  a human’s  visual  system. 
Driver drowsiness detection is a form of car safety technology and is used to prevent accidents that are caused by the driver of the car getting drowsy or sleepy. In this project, we have used CNN through Python and data provided by Prasad Patil on kaggle to teach the model how to detect a driver’s drowsiness through eye monitoring.
